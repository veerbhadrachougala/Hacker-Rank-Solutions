// Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

// Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

// The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
// The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
// Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

// Example



// Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day,  with a length equalling his birth month, . In this case, there are two segments meeting her criteria:  and .

// Function Description

// Complete the birthday function in the editor below.

// birthday has the following parameter(s):

// int s[n]: the numbers on each of the squares of chocolate
// int d: Ron's birth day
// int m: Ron's birth month
// Returns

// int: the number of ways the bar can be divided
